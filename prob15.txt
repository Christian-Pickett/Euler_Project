Lattice paths - Problem 15 
https://projecteuler.net/problem=15

Problem Description:
Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?

Combinatorial solution:
We can only choose two directions: right and down. Each possible path from the top left of the grid to the bottom right of the grid takes exactly 40 steps. If we arbitrarily choose 20 places to go right or down to begin, then we have 20 choices left.

Using the binomial coefficient, we can choose 20 from 40:

40! / (20! * (40 - 20)!) = 

(40*39*38*37*36*35*34*33*32*31*30*29*28*27*26*25*24*23*22*21)/20! =
